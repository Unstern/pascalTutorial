1. Show that any repeat statement can be written using if and while.
	Consider the general forms of both control structures:

	repeat						while Boolean do
		begin						begin
			S1;							S1;
			.							.
			.							.	
			.							.
			Sn 							Sn
		end  						end;
	until not Boolean;

	Consider the semantics of each structure as follows:

	|<repeat...until>|, Repeats a set of commands, check if Boolean, if it's true, stop, otherwise, repeat
						the iteration.

	|<while...do>|, Check the Boolean, if it's true, execute the enclosed set of commands, otherwise, stop

	repeat...unitl, executes the set pf instructions at least once.

	if not Boolean then
		assignments
	while not Boolean do
		begin
			S1; ... Sn
		end;

2. The converse (while can be written using if and repeat).

	Same idea
